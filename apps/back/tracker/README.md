# Tracker-API

The goal of this microservice is to be called by trackerBack.js and trackerFront.js and to store datas inside a mongoDB database

It allows to:

- Provide datas requested in order to display them inside ChartJs for example. How?
- => By aggregated querys for a conversion tunnel (if possible generic) for two or more tables
